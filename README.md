# Monthly_Procurement_Performance_Report
 Data Analysis · Analytical Skills · Data Visualization · Performance Reporting · Microsoft Power BI · Data Cleaning · Microsoft Excel
This sample project was requested by the executive management of a telecom company for the management to have a better understanding of how the company is operating and performing on a monthly basis and to make better decisions based on that information. My role in this project was to collect the data from the client company's ERP system as Excel spreadsheets then clean, sort, and modify the data using MS Excel and finally prepare and present dashboard reports using Power BI Desktop. The final report was clear and easy to understand for the management and as a result, was well received. Samples of the report files have been attached for reference with the permission of the company.
